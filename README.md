# MetaNetOps — Network Production Engineering Lab

Docs-first Network Production Engineering lab inspired by large-scale backbone + datacenter operations.

This repo demonstrates how I would operate, debug, and improve a production network at scale:
- Monitoring signals (loss/latency/jitter)
- Incident response + safe mitigation
- Routing & failure-mode reasoning (BGP / ISIS concepts)
- Automation-first workflows (Python tooling)
- Change safety, rollback, and postmortems

## Status
🚧 Initial scaffolding (actively evolving)

## Planned structure
