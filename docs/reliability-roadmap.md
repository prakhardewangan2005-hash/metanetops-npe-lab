# Network Reliability Roadmap

## Goal
Continuously improve network reliability
through planned engineering initiatives.

---

## Current State
- Manual incident response
- Reactive alerting
- Limited predictive capacity planning

---

## Near-Term (0–3 Months)
- Improve alert → runbook mappings
- Add packet loss detection at edge
- Tune BGP flap alerts

---

## Mid-Term (3–6 Months)
- Expand safe automation
- Add anomaly detection
- Improve capacity forecasting

---

## Long-Term (6–12 Months)
- Self-healing network workflows
- Predictive failure detection
- Automated change validation

---

## Success Metrics
- Reduced MTTR
- Fewer SEV-1 incidents
- Improved SLO compliance

---
